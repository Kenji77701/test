Technologies

1. JavaScript/Typescript — this repo is in a hybrid state. A lot of the newer code is being written in Typescript & the old code is slowly being ported over.
2. React — the whole front-end across all platforms is built using React.
3. React Native — For mobile apps we are using React Native
4. Electron — For desktop app
5. NPM — listed here because we **don't** use Yarn or PNPM or XYZ across any of our projects.
6. Nx — maintaining monorepos is hard but Nx makes it easier.
